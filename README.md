# DailyBread

## Elevator Pitch  
Studying the Bible every day isn‚Äôt always easy. That‚Äôs why we created **DailBread**‚Äîa web application designed to help users grow spiritually through consistent scripture study. DailyBread motivates daily reading with a streak counter, leaderboards, league advancement, and other engaging gamified features. Think of it as the **‚ÄúDuolingo‚Äù for the Bible**‚Äîmaking scripture study rewarding, interactive, and spiritually uplifting.  

## Key Features  
- Streak Counter  
- Leaderboard  
- League Advancement  
- Login, Logout, and Register  
- See High Scores  
- Notifications (e.g., daily reminders, league advancement status)  

## Technologies  
I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways:  

- **HTML** ‚Äì Basic structural and organizational elements of each web page, login/register controls, about page.  
- **CSS** ‚Äì Styling and animating the application, including button highlighting.  
- **React** ‚Äì Single-page view for scripture reading, rendering leaderboard, league status, and streak counter. State hooks.  
- **Service** ‚Äì Endpoints for authentication, storing/retrieving scores, API call for Bible text.  
- **Database** ‚Äì Stores streak counter scores, user information, leaderboards, login information, etc.  
- **WebSocket** ‚Äì Sending reminder notifications.

## CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I properly styled the application into its final appearance.

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body**
- [x] **Navigation elements** - I used bootstreap to make the nav bar much more appealing with the links right aligned and the logo built into it. 
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - My app looks great on all window sizes and devices. I wish I could have done a little more with this, but I am happy with how it turned out.
- [x] **Application elements** - I used the boostrap theme, and am happy with how the colors turned out. I added a table and used the table alert class and card class for styling. I also added styling to the form elements and relavent buttons. 
- [x] **Application text content** - Consistent fonts. Again, this comes from the boostrap themes. 
- [x] **Application images** - I centered and rounded the image on the about page. I think it looks nice. 

## React deliverable
- [x] **Bundled using Vite** Vite is installed in my project and I am using it to bundle my React code.
- [x] **Multiple React components** My leaderboard, login, about, and read pages are delivered using React. This is clealry visible in the project URL where the .html extension is absent. I changed several componets to use React bootstrap components.
- [x] **React router** I am using React Router to handle navigation between the different views.
