# DailyBread

## Elevator Pitch  
Studying the Bible every day isn’t always easy. That’s why we created **DailBread**—a web application designed to help users grow spiritually through consistent scripture study. DailyBread motivates daily reading with a streak counter, leaderboards, league advancement, and other engaging gamified features. Think of it as the **“Duolingo” for the Bible**—making scripture study rewarding, interactive, and spiritually uplifting.  

## Key Features  
- Streak Counter  
- Leaderboard  
- League Advancement  
- Login, Logout, and Register  
- See High Scores  
- Notifications (e.g., daily reminders, league advancement status)  

## Technologies  
I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways:  

- **HTML** – Basic structural and organizational elements of each web page, login/register controls, about page.  
- **CSS** – Styling and animating the application, including button highlighting.  
- **React** – Single-page view for scripture reading, rendering leaderboard, league status, and streak counter. State hooks.  
- **Service** – Endpoints for authentication, storing/retrieving scores, API call for Bible text.  
- **Database** – Stores streak counter scores, user information, leaderboards, login information, etc.  
- **WebSocket** – Sending reminder notifications.
